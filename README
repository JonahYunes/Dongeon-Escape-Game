ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
An evil Sorcerer has captured a group of players and trapped them in a monster-filled, 
labyrinthine dungeon for their own amusement. The goal of this game is to make it out of 
the dungeon with as many party members alive as possible. Each turn in the dungeon makes 
you hungrier (reduces fullness) and has risks such as monsters and traps. 
You can fight monsters, speak to NPCs, and explore, but you must make it 
through the dungeon before the Sorcerer runs out of patience and destroys the dungeon, 
along with the player and all the party members!
